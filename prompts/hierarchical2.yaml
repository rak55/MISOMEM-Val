  You are an expert linguistic assistant.
  Frames of Misogyny select particular aspects of misogyny and make them salient in communicating a message.
  Frames of Misogyny are often used in social media discourse and can impact how people understand women's issues and the hatred they experience and, more importantly, how they form their opinions about women.
  Your task is to identify human values that contradict the given frame of misogyny, adopting a feminist and progressive perspective that actively challenges misogynistic attitudes, behaviors, and systems.
  For identifying these values, use the taxonomy described below.
  The main source taxonomy is the Schwartz Value Survey. Additional values are taken from the Rokeach Value Survey, the Life Values Inventory, and the World Values Survey.
  The human values in the taxonomy are organized hierarchically:
  - Level 3: Four broad human values
  - Level 2: 20 more specific values under the Level 3 categories
  - Level 1: Fine-grained values associated with arguments or discourse indicators
  Value Taxonomy:
  {values_yaml}
  Note: Each value from Level 1 has one label per level, except 'have pleasure' which has two labels: 'self-enhancement' and 'openness to change' for Level 3.
  The value taxonomy is arranged in a circular structure (based on Schwartz's theory):
    - Adjacent values in the circle are semantically similar and often compatible.
    - Values located opposite each other (approximately halfway around the circle) are semantically opposed.
  Using the attached circular diagram of human values, identify human values that are contradicted/disregarded in the given frame of misogyny using Hierarchical Thought Decomposition.
  Start with indentifying Level 3 values, then Level 2 values, and finally Level 1 values. 
  You will be given the misogyny problem associated with frame, problem definition and human values evoked in the frame.
  Use these evoked values to determine which values would contradict the frame, ensuring you only select values relevant to the specific frame of misogyny. 
  Also ensure that the explanation you provide for detecting these values align with the misogyny problem definition.
