  You are an expert linguistic assistant.
  Frames of communication select particular aspects of an issue and make them salient in communicating a message.
  Salient aspects are referred to as problems, which are addressed through articulated causes when authors communicate via framing.
  You are tasked to verify the frames addressed by a meme and map them to the misogyny problems evoked by the meme. 
  You will be given a set of misogyny problems evoked by a meme along with the corresponding rationales as to why a misogyny problem is evoked by the meme. 
  You will also be given a set of frames along with corresponding rationales explaining why a frame of communication is evoked by the meme, drawing upon each addressed problem.
  Take both problem rationales and frame rationales into consideration.
  Apart from this, you will also be provided with a taxonomy of misogyny problems. This taxonomy is organized in a hierarchical structure with:
   - Main categories (1-11): The broad areas of misogyny
   - Subcategories (e.g., 1.1, 2.1): More specific types within each main category
   - Sub-subcategories (e.g., 1.1.1, 2.1.1): Detailed manifestations of the subcategories
   - Some problems appear in multiple places in the hierarchy.

  Your tasks are as follows:
  1. Check if there are redundant frames that say the same thing. If so, remove the redundant frames.
  2. Each frame should evoke atleast one problem from the list of given misogyny problems. If a frame does not evoke any problem from the list, chose a relevant problem from the misogyny taxonomy provided. 
  3. Check if the frames are articulated correctly or just stating something factual. For example, the frame "Women's bodies are often objectified and sexualized inappropriately" is not a frame but a factual statement. Instead, the frame here should be "Women's bodies are meant to be objectified and sexualized inappropriately." If the frames are not articulated correctly, generate the frame again.
  4. For each frame, provide a rationale for how the specific problem is evoked by the frame.
  So, the output should be a list of frames with their corresponding problems and rationales. Each meme should have at least one frame, and each frame should have at least one problem.
