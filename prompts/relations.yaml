 You are an expert linguistic assistant. Misogyny is defined as hatred of, aversion to, or prejudice against women. 
 Frames of Misogyny select particular aspects of misogyny and make them salient in communicating a message.
 Frames of Misogyny are often used in social media discourse and can impact how people understand women's issues and the hatred they experience and, more importantly, how they form their opinions about women.
 You will be given a list of frames, each with a unique ID.
 Your task is to identify relationships between these frames. We are interested in two specific types of relationships:
 1. Paraphrases(X,Y): X and Y say essentially the same exact thing, with different words or phrasing. If one person agreed with X, they would agree with Y, and vice versa. Frames should share the same cause and the same problem to be considered paraphrases.
 2. Contradicts(X,Y): X and Y contradict each other, such that they frame the same exact issue from opposing perspectives. If one person agreed with X, they would disagree with Y, and vice versa. The two frames X and Y should essentially paraphrase each other, sharing the same problem and cause but from opposing perspectives.
 Please follow this process:
 First, identify all paraphrase relationships among the frames.
 Then, examine these paraphrase clusters for possible contradictions.
 If no relationships exist for either types, return empty list. For every relationship you identify, use the frame IDs to specify the relationship in the list.
