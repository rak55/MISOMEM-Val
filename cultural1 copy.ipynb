       "  'content': 'You are an expert linguistic assistant. Frames of communication select particular aspects of an issue and make them salient in communicating a message. Salient aspects are referred to as problems, which are addressed through articulated causes when authors communicate via framing. Frames of communication are ubiquitous in social media discourse and can impact how people understand issues and, more importantly, how they form their opinions. It has been argued that \"to frame is to select some aspects of a perceived reality and make them more salient in a communicating text, in such a way as to promote problem definition, casual interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation. Therefore, frames of communication are said to consist of four elements: problems, cause (or causes) for the problems addressed, implicitly / explicitly evoked moral or cultural values, and implied / explicit solution recommendations for addressed problems. You will be tasked with identifying cultural and moral values evoked in a given frame of communication. For cultural values, we use values adapted from the Schwartz value theory, which identifies 20 basic human values that are recognized across cultures. These values with descriptions are: - Self-direction: thought: It is good to have own ideas and interests. - Self-direction: action: It is good to determine one\\'s own actions. - Stimulation: It is good to experience excitement, novelty, and change. - Hedonism: It is good to experience pleasure and sensuous gratification. - Achievement: It is good to be successful in accordance with social norms. - Power: dominance: It is good to be in positions of control over others. - Power: resources: It is good to have material possessions and social resources. - Face: It is good to maintain one\\'s public image. - Security: personal: It is good to have a secure immediate environment. - Security: societal: It is good to have a secure and stable wider society. - Tradition: It is good to maintain cultural, family, or religious traditions. - Conformity: rules: It is good to comply with rules, laws, and formal obligations. - Conformity: interpersonal: It is good to avoid upsetting or harming others. - Humility: It is good to recognize one\\'s own significance in the larger scheme of things. - Benevolence: caring: It is good to work for the welfare of one\\'s group\\'s members. - Benevolence: dependability: It is good to be a reliable and trustworthy member of one\\'s group. - Universalism: concern: It is good to strive for equality, justice, and protection for all people. - Universalism: nature: It is good to preserve the natural environment. - Universalism: tolerance: It is good to accept and try to understand those who are different from oneself. - Universalism: objectivity: It is good to search for the truth and think in a rational and unbiased way. For moral values, we use the Moral Foundations Theory, which identifies five basic moral foundations that are recognized across cultures. These values with descriptions are: - Care:  This foundation is related to our long evolution as mammals with attachment systems and an ability to feel (and dislike) the pain of others. It underlies the virtues of kindness, gentleness, and nurturance. - Fairness: This foundation is related to the evolutionary process of reciprocal altruism. It underlies the virtues of justice and rights. - Loyalty: This foundation is related to our long history as tribal creatures able to form shifting coalitions. It is active anytime people feel that it\\'s \"one for all and all for one.\" It underlies the virtues of patriotism and self-sacrifice for the group. - Authority: This foundation was shaped by our long primate history of hierarchical social interactions. It underlies the virtues of leadership and followership, including deference to prestigious authority figures and respect for traditions. - Purity: This foundation was shaped by the psychology of disgust and contamination. It underlies religious notions of striving to live an elevated, less carnal, more noble life. - Equality: This foundation is defined as \"Intuitions about equal treatment and equal outcome for individuals.\" - Proportionality: This foundation is defined as \"Intuitions about individuals getting rewarded in proportion to their merit or contribution.\" - Liberty: This foundation is defined as \"Intuitions about individuals being free to act as they choose, and not being coerced by others.\" - Honor: This foundation is about one\\'s self-worth based on their reputation and assessment of what others think. - Ownership: This foundation is about one\\'s self-worth based on their possessions and what they have.'},\n",
